Along with being easy to store and transport, this assault rifle is a common weapon for Federation Mobile Suits. The Mk. 2 MG76 possesses with modifications made after the Battle of Loum. The most noticeable changes is its extended barrel and improved hand grip, allowing for tighter shot placements and increased muzzle velocity. The addition of small tarp coverings over part seams has improved the service lifespan of the MG76 by preventing debris from getting into the weapon whether in space or land combat.</div>",

However as it’s meant to be used similarly to a police shotgun, its primary ammunition is the Tactical Adhesive Round, or TAR Shells. These “less-than-lethal” shells launch pellets of adhesive material to restrict movement, though mainly intended to delay rather than incapacitate as the adhesive can be broken with enough force from most mobile suits. TAR shells are to be treated with equal caution as their lethal counterparts, as the adhesive itself can hit with enough force to easily shatter human bones and wreck cars given the size of the shell. With the onset of the war, the Riot Cannon has also gotten ammunition designed for it that fires \"Mechshot\" for engaging actual mobile suits in combat.<br></div>",

While each round is somewhat weaker than those used by tanks in order to accommodate its fully automatic action, a burst of these rounds can cause major damage to most tanks. Its pan magazine allows for a larger number of shells to be stored.Further upgrades were made to the ZMP-50D after encountering difficulty against the armor of mid-war Earth Federation mobile suits and even main battle tanks, resulting in the ZMP-50D2 model.
