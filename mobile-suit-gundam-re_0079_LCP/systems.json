The rocket launcher consists of a warhead filled with a fuse and gunpowder, to which is attached a tube with solid fuel that acts as a rocket for propulsion. To enhance straight-line propulsion, folded stabilizing wings are installed, and they unfold immediately after launch. The launch tube only had a launcher attached to it. When the rocket launches, a jet of flame flares out from the rear of the tube. After firing, the tube is discarded. The Sturm Faust could be regarded as a kind of recoilless gun. It is said to have an effective range of 600 meters, but in reality, it is necessary to move closer to be able to hit the target. Furthermore, as the warhead is not equipped with a guidance device, it is extremely hard to use the Sturm Faust to hit a moving target accurately. However, it is still a highly destructive portable weapon.</div><div>Used in anti-ship and anti-MS battles, this weapon does not require special equipment, such as a manipulator equipped with a connector for ignition, so it could be operated by any MS that can move its fingers. In addition, it was easier to handle than recoilless guns, and its disposable nature made it a popular weapon of Zeon's mobile suits from the middle to the end of the One Year War. Its simple structure also made it easy to manufacture, and after the end of the One Year War, when supply became difficult, many remnants of the Principality of Zeon used this armament. Due to its excellent cost performance, the Sturm Faust is still in use even in U.C.0090s. The same type of armament is also used by the Federation's MS, but the name \"Sturm Faust\" is frowned upon as being \"Zeon-like,\" and they are often referred to as \"clubs\" because of their shape.</div>",
