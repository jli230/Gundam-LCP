The most noticeable changes is its extended barrel and improved hand grip, allowing for tighter shot placements and increased muzzle velocity. The addition of small tarp coverings over part seams has improved the service lifespan of the MG76 by preventing debris from getting into the weapon whether in space or land combat.</div>",

The rifle can fire 12-15 shots when fully charged. It also features an offset, movable sensor that interfaces with the RX-78’s Fire Control System (FCS) to achieve a high degree of accuracy, as well as a foregrip for firing support.

The barrel of the rifle was machined with unusually high precision in order to ensure excellent ballistic performance, which also consequently raised the production cost of the weapon. Further compounding this long-range performance and the subsequent price increase is the use of a 76.2mm round based on British anti-tank ammunition that hasn't been in production for over two centuries. The primary ammunition is an Armor-Penetrating Fragmenting Shell, a round that is fitted with an explosive filler that, upon penetrating the target, explodes the round into numerous shrapnel that is intended to cause it and the resulting spalling to ricochet at high speeds inside a mobile suit in order to destroy internal subsystems.</div>",
